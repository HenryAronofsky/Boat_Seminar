  ### Week 7: Composites
  
  Plane and sand the exterior chine in preparation for fiberglass tape. Learn how to use fiberglass tape and resin to seal and reinforce the seams.

  #### Team speed docs
  This week and sanded down the hull of the boat so that it was flush with the sides and then added the fiberglass tape to reinforce the sides of the boat. We added the tape by smoothing it over the hull and then adding epoxy to cement it down. We also started to fabricate our gunwales, both inwales and outwales. We had to cut two lengths of thin square wood at an angle before epoxying them together and clamping them to a piece of alluminum in an L-shape to maintain their shape. We ended up having to install the gunwales outside of class and did so by epoxying them to the boat and screwing them in.

  Assignment: Document your work on your teamâ€™s website. Reading: The Craftsman, Part 2.1 (pp. 149-193).
