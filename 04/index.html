  ### Week 4: Shop Orientation. Cutting Pieces

  Trace your team’s outlines onto plywood, cut large pieces with a jigsaw to form the hull of the boat. Learn to safely operate a table router and sanders to finish pieces. Join large pieces together with butt joints and coat them with at least one layer of epoxy. 

  #### Team speed docs
  This week moved us into fabrication as we entered 38 Oxford street. We started out by using the cardboard profile we had cut last week as outlines on the plywood. We traced the shapes with sharpie and then used a jigsaw to cut them out. We sanded our edges a little bit before combining the six pieces we cut into pairs, the two sides and then the hull. We ended up having to come in out of class period to finish epoxying all of the pieces as two coats were required.
 
  Assignment: Document your work on your team’s website. Reading: The Survival of the Bark Canoe, pp. 50-100.
